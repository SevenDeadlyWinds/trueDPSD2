# Reload speed is how fast your gun reloads. You can get this by clipping a reload, then using the time stamps to figure out when your reload starts and ends. Reload count is how many times you reload during a mag dump
#
# Time to fire is how fast your gun can fire before either firing again, or reloading. Again, clipping and timestamps.
